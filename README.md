ðŸŒŸ **We Grow Even More with Foreign Languages!** ðŸŒŸ

Hello! I am Can, a developer who continues to explore new frontiers in the world of software and technology. I need your support in my journey to learn foreign languages. Writing code and developing projects is my passion, but communicating with people from different cultures is also among my goals.

Your sponsorships will provide me with great motivation and support in my language learning process. I will use the language skills I have acquired during this process to create better collaboration and a wider impact area in open source projects.

With your support, I will take important steps towards developing both myself and my community, as well as creating a more accessible and global technology world. Thank you in advance for your contributions!
